1) Interface
Color: _ Use two main colors: BLACK, RED according to the web logo's color
       _ White color for text (#ffffff)
       _ Black color for background (#000)
       _ Red for highlight text, hover text, button,... (#ff0000)
NavBar:_ Add hover animation for navbar items.
       _ Change the navbar item active color from white to red.
Footer:_ Adding the icon contact

2) Development
Using Vue3+Vite for developing frontend which decrease time for building project for developer and enhance the user expirience.
Using Vue Router to navigation between pages which will make the page no more reload when user change the navbar items.
